ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @hmazomba. Iâ€™m still interested in game development but not as much any more. I'm a little busy these days, so I'll be using my AI tools a lot to try out new things I've never done before in software. I want to have a look at RUST and maybe go back to C++. If you're looking for advice or looking to collaborate on some kickass Python projects. Don't hesitate. How to reach me: hmazomba@live.co.za
